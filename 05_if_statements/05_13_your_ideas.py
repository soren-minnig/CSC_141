When I get better at programming, I'd like to eventually make an RPG.

I would want it to be a dark-fantasy turn-based RPG, with inspirations ranging
from the Persona series, Final Fantasy, and Fear and Hunger.

Graphics-wise, my current plan would be to use 2.5D graphics (like Octopath
Traveler), since I think it would give a distinctive style.

I want the combat to be visually attractive. I'm thinking of something akin to 
Persona 5, but a bit more violent to match the dark-fantasy genre. There would
be a way to develop character's stats and skills to make them stronger.

Finally, I'd want there to be some sort of bond system so you could learn more
about the characters.

I've already made characters, written some of the story, and created some basic
pixel sprites with animations.

As I continue learning, I'd like to develop different parts of my vision for a
game.
