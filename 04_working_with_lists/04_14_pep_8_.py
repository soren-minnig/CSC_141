I have been trying to adhere to the PEP 8 style guidelines throughout my code.

This could mean including appropriate blank spaces, using indentation, and
ensuring each line is less than 80 characters.

Additionally, sometimes I opt for a slightly longer line of code if it increases
the program's readability.
An example of this might include replacing the "else" statement with another
"elif" if it makes the conditions needed to run it more clear:

if age < 13:
    print(something1)
elif age < 18:
    print(something2)
elif age < 65:
    print(something3)
elif age > 65:
    print(something4)

Here, it is made more clear to the reader that "something4" will only be printed
if the age is greater than 65. While "else" could work, it may be less clear.
