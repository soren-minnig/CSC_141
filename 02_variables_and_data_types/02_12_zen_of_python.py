"The Zen of Python" reflects on basic Python principles.

For example, code should be as succinct as possible. Generally, your code
shouldn't be hard to understand, or to explain.
If it is, there is probably an easier solution.

This idea also includes readability.
When others read your code, they should be able to discern what's going on
without having to rack their brain.

Additionally, most problems will have a straightforward solution, though this
solution might not always be immediately obvious.
