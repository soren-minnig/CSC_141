I have limited programming experience.

At most, I've messed around in ren.py to make basic visual novels. I played around with things such as random number generators, text effects, and positioning(for sprites).
I took a foundations of computer science class in my freshman year of high school, but I didn't learn much from it(at least, things I didn't already know).
I've followed some of the beginner tutorials on programs such as Unity, Unreal, etc.

I've used conditional statements(e.g. else and elif). I have also used other keywords including pass and return. I have used "true" and "false" statements.

My previous experience can help me understand keywords that I've used in the past. It may be easier to solve problems with my existing knowledge of programming
by knowing how certain concepts work in code and how they are applied.
