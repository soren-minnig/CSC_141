I have limited coding experience.

At most, I've messed around in ren.py to make basic visual novels. I played around with different fonts, text effects, and stage directions.

I've also used basic calls such as "label", "return", "if ___", "else", and "elif".

This could help me implement them into my code in order to simplify it.
