I have limited programming experience.

At most, I've messed around in ren.py to make basic visual novels. I played around with things such as random number generators, text effects, and positioning(for sprites).

I've used conditional statements(e.g. else and elif).

I have also used other keywords including pass and return. I have used "true" and "false" statements.

My previous experience can help me understand keywords that I've used in the past.
